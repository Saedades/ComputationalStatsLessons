Please compile the project with the `_build.sh` file since there is a bug with the mathjax import in html output. 


To put this compiling, you need to install the following packages:

- bookdown
- plotly
- dplyr


You can run `install.packages(c("bookdown","plotly","dplyr"))`

Once these packages are installed, you just have to run in this directory the following:

`./_build.sh`
